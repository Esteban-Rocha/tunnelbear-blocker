### Submitting code changes

For core code changes, we strongly recommend you upstream your contributions to [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Should you decide to submit it to us anyway, we will attempt to upstream any relevant changes to uBlock Origin with your authorship intact.

This is a decision made out of respect for the uBlock Origin community; it is also our goal to sync with upstream periodically.

For TunnelBear Blocker specific code changes, we will accept pull requests via Github and accredit you appropriately.

### Reporting issues
For **specific site issues**, please use the report button within the extension.

For **general issues**, please contact [TunnelBear support](https://www.tunnelbear.com/support).

For **more technical issues**, we accept reports through the Github issues interface.

In both cases, please provide us with the exact steps needed to reproduce the problem. Example of detailed steps:
> 1. Browser version/TunnelBear Blocker version
> 1. The settings you have enabled
> 1. Do this
> 1. Open this exact URL
> 1. Do this
> 1. Observe this
> 1. Click this
> 1. Observe such and such issue
> 1. See screenshot
> 1. etc.

The fastest way for us to solve your issue is when **detailed steps** are provided.

### Before you submit

1. _One specific_ issue per submission.
1. Please do not post comments like "+1" or "me too!" without providing new, relevant info on the issue. It tends to drown out potentially useful information, and ends up wasting development resources.
1. Verify that the issue does **not** occur with TunnelBear Blocker disabled.
1. Verify that the issue is not caused by another extension.
1. Only report issues that can be reproduce in an official stable release or a beta release, and **NOT** on a Canary release.

### What to include

To help diagnose and fix the bug/issue, please always include the following in your report:

* A clear list of steps to reproduce the problem
  * **ALWAYS INCLUDE A SPECIFIC URL WHERE THE ISSUE OCCURS**, _even_ if "it happens everywhere".
* Symptoms of the issue
  * Describe what you observe and consider broken behavior; this is what we'll be looking for after executing the steps
  * Example: video doesn't start playing, page layout broken
* A screenshot or transcription of any TunnelBear Blocker settings that differ from the defaults
  * This includes a whitelisted website, enabled/disabled blocking items, etc.
  * Please do include everything different from the defaults whether or not it seems relevant to your issue
* The version of Blocker you're having the issue with; you can find this in by going to your [extensions page](chrome://extensions/); it will be the number beside the TunnelBear Blocker title.
  * Example: `TunnelBear Blocker 0.9.1`
* The browser you're using and its version
  * Examples: `Chrome 41.0.2272`
* The OS you're using and its version
  * Examples: `Windows 10`, `Linux Mint 17.1`
* A list of other extensions you have installed
  * Tip: try disabling them and see if your issue still occurs

Otherwise, a lot of your time and ours gets spent on exchanging back and forth to get this information, rather than actually fixing the problem. That makes us sad bears. ):
