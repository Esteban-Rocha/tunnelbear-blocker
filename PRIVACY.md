### Privacy Policy

TunnelBear Blocker does **NOT** collect any data in any form within the extension itself.

The only data we have are as follows:

1. Installation counts, as provided by the Google Chrome store.

2. Broken site feedback reports, which are only submitted by the user's own choice.

Neither of these two pieces of information will EVER be shared with third-parties.
