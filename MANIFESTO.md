### TunnelBear Blocker manifesto

Our beliefs are 100% in line with that of the [uBlock project](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/MANIFESTO.md),
and our manifesto merely serves as an extension of uBlock's manifesto. Simply put, this means the following:

1. The **user decides** what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.

2. We will provide every user with the tools and means to do so simply and effectively.
